For this lab I worked closely with my lab3 to make sure that all 3 of my APIs would display the relevant data.
For the new API I worked with it so it would display all of the information in a table format as well as be able to compare the two of the currencies as well. This proved as a challenge as I had to reference stack overflow a few times as cited below to make sure that my data was actually being able to be passed along correctly. I was also running into unexpected error 500 when trying to connect to php but was able to get around that by looking at it line by line
