# Lab 3
For this lab I referenced back to lab 10 of Intro to ITWS. In that lab we learned how to connect our JavaScript to our PHP and then have it be retrieved / added into SQL. I was able to remember what I performed last time and then apply it to this lab. To begin working I first downloaded XAMPP to be able to test phpmyadmin locally (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). In the setup I followed this tutorial for setup instructions https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-started-with-php/. As part of this I was having port issues and followed this youtube video to change what port it ran on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjYxxYlXkOs. After this was setup I was able to start testing my work locally. For the PHP - SQL I created four php files: two to retrieve from SQL and two to insert, one set per API. While doing this I referenced https://stackoverflow.com/questions/682260/returning-json-from-php-to-javascript on how to pass the data back and fourth in a JSON format. 

For the labs requirments of "giving your users a way to change the data they see, and overwrite the existing database entry with the changes the user made," I created a previous and next button to pick the sols for mars as well as two checkboxes to allow the user to select if they want to see seasons, weather or conditions
