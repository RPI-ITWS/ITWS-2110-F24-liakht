# Lab 2
For this lab I had to reference a lot of material and documentation whenever I got stuck, I documted it all below.
I started by finding the two APIs that I wanted to use which I decided on the weather maps API and the NASA API. 
For the weather maps API I used this link https://openweathermap.org/current. It helped me understand what I should
pass in and what I should expect back. For NASA I found the Insight (Mars weather) API which gives me back info
on current weather on mars, found here https://api.nasa.gov/. 

Using these two APIs I created the backend with minor difficulties. One roadblock that I came to was converting a 
unix time to something a user can understand. For this I found help online through this discussion post: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/847185/convert-a-unix-timestamp-to-time-in-javascript. The last problem I ran 
into was learning the geolocation API. The w3 schools tutorial (https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_nav_geolocation.asp) helped me understand how to implement and develop it. 

For the frontend I reused a lot of my knowledge from Intro to ITWS for the styling and for the mars and earth icons I used Flaticon.
